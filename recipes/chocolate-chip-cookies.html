    <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or 
        chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies 
        originated in the United States around 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield 
        chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate 
        to a cookie recipe.
